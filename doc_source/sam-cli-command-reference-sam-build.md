# sam build<a name="sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build"></a>

Use this command to build your Lambda source code and generate deployment artifacts that target Lambda's execution environment, so the functions you build locally will run in a similar environment in the AWS Cloud\.

The `sam build` command iterates through the functions in your application, looks for a manifest file \(such as `requirements.txt`\) that contain the dependencies, and automatically creates deployment artifacts that you can deploy to Lambda using the `sam package` and `sam deploy` commands\. You that can also use `sam build` in combination with other commands like `sam local invoke` to test your appliation locally\.

To use this command, update your AWS SAM template to specify the path to your function's source code in the resource's Code or CodeUri property\.

**Usage:**

```
sam build [OPTIONS]
```

**Examples:**

```
To build on your workstation, run this command in folder containing
SAM template. Built artifacts will be written to .aws-sam/build folder
$ sam build
 
To build inside a AWS Lambda like Docker container
$ sam build --use-container
  
To build & run your functions locally
$ sam build && sam local invoke
  
To build and package for deployment
$ sam build && sam package --s3-bucket <bucketname>
```

**Options:**


****  

| Option | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| \-b, \-\-build\-dir DIRECTORY | Path to a folder where the built artifacts will be stored\. | 
| \-s, \-\-base\-dir DIRECTORY | Resolve relative paths to function's source code with respect to this folder\. Use this if the SAM template and your source code are not in same enclosing folder\. By default, relative paths are resolved with respect to the SAM template's location\. | 
| \-u, \-\-use\-container | If your functions depend on packages that have natively compiled dependencies, use this flag to build your function inside an AWS Lambda\-like Docker container\. | 
| \-m, \-\-manifest PATH | Path to a custom dependency manifest \(ex: package\.json\) to use instead of the default one\. | 
| \-t, \-\-template PATH | AWS SAM template file \[default: template\.\[yaml\|yml\]\] | 
| \-\-parameter\-overrides | Optional\. A string that contains AWS CloudFormation parameter overrides, encoded as key=value pairs\. Use the same format as the AWS CLI, e\.g\. 'ParameterKey=KeyPairName, ParameterValue=MyKey ParameterKey=InstanceType, ParameterValue=t1\.micro' | 
| \-\-skip\-pull\-image | Specify whether the command should skip pulling down the latest Docker image for Lambda runtime\. | 
| \-\-docker\-network TEXT | Specifies the name or id of an existing Docker network to Lambda Docker containers should connect to, along with the default bridge network\. If not specified, the Lambda containers will only connect to the default bridge Docker network\. | 
| \-\-debug | Turn on debug logging to print debug message generated by SAM CLI\. | 
| \-\-region TEXT | Set the AWS Region of the service \(e\.g\. us\-east\-1\)\. | 
| \-\-profile TEXT | Select a specific profile from your credential file to get AWS credentials\. | 
| \-\-help | Shows this message and exits\. |
